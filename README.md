UpLoadMyIp
==========


Purpose
---------
To make raspberry pi always accessable from ssh (I have no monitor),

so I made this little script to push pi's IP address onto Github.


Install
--------
Need ruby env to be installed

Arch user can install directly from official repo
```
$ pacman -S ruby

```

Config
--------
I am using zsh shell, so you should config ~/.zprofile file
```
$ vim ~/.zprofile
```
